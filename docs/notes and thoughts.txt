===================
Notes/Thoughts:  
===================

-We decided that users will have to register with a valid .edu email address, so that way we know they are a student, we can automatically determine what school they are at(for the purposes of class lists, etc), and we can control who can register based on what schools we support


-Perhaps we should move forward looking at this as two projects, an android application(StudyBear) and a server application(StudyBear's Tush)


-We should go into more detail on the algorithm for matchmaking
	=We discussed finding people who had the same classes and availability (and are not on a block list)
	=How are those people ranked? (being online in the application should move them up)
	=Should we store user responses to matches, whether they say yes/no to suggestions? (I think so)
	=What are ways we could use to suggest potential matches even if availability does not match? (learn, predict, and suggesting beyond the availability entered by the user)


-Do we care about availability?  In other words, is that more personal information than a user would want to enter and could we make suggestions without it?  Just match people up based on their current/past classes, their history of match responses, and their study groups


-How should we structure this repo of our project?  Do we want multiple branches like release, dev, under-review, etc?


-We should study some of the tools GitHub offers to make our lives easier collaborating on this project.  For example, pull requests supposed to be a good way to do bug/new feature tracking, and submit changes for review


-Perhaps there should be some sort of version history document that keeps track of features as we add them, and then a planned update document that is our roadmap going forward
	=We could put version history at the bottom of the README
	=maybe github could help keep track of the planned updates
